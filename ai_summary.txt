	* IP Address: 192.168.1.5
	* Attempts: 3
	* Time Window: 64 seconds
	* Severity: MEDIUM
	* Description: An attacker attempted to gain unauthorized access to the system using a brute force attack. The IP address 192.168.1.5 was detected attempting to log in with multiple combinations of usernames and passwords within a short time frame.
2. **SQL Injection Attempt**:
	* IP Address: 10.0.0.3
	* Time: February 13, 2026, 10:02:10 UTC
	* Keyword: UNION SELECT
	* Severity: HIGH
	* Description: An attacker attempted to inject malicious SQL code into the system, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
3. **Suspicious Admin Access**:
	* IP Address: 172.16.0.9
	* Attempts: 2
	* Time Window: 40 seconds
	* Severity: MEDIUM
	* Description: An attacker attempted to access administrative privileges on the system, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or data modifications.

**Potential Impact:**

The detected attacks pose a significant risk to the system's security and integrity. If left unchecked, these attacks could lead to:

* Unauthorized access to sensitive data
* System compromise or data modification
* Potential data breaches or loss of confidentiality

**Recommended Mitigation Actions:**

1. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for all administrative access to prevent brute force attacks and unauthorized access.
2. **Update SQL Injection Protection**: Review and update the system's SQL injection protection measures to prevent malicious code injection.
3. **Monitor and Block Suspicious IP Addresses**: Block IP addresses 192.168.1.5, 10.0.0.3, and 172.16.0.9 from accessing the system to prevent further attacks.
4. **Conduct Regular Security Audits**: Schedule regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
5. **Provide User Education and Awareness**: Educate users on the importance of secure password management, MFA, and reporting suspicious activity.

**Next Steps:**

1. Investigate the source of the attacks and identify potential vulnerabilities.
2. Implement the recommended mitigation actions to prevent future attacks.
3. Continuously monitor the system for potential security threats and incidents.
